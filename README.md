# RecoverableStreamEx

Streams are the best way to handle "potentially infinite" data:
imagine a query scanning a table with a filter and returning rows
in batches. E.g. `Postgrex.stream/4` provides an interface like
that. 

But what happens if a connection to a database stutters?
The entire stream would fail. Then an app should retry. But what
if retrying from the beginning is expensive? It could mean that
the database has to re-scan hundreds of GBs. Can we avoid that?
Can we make it transparent for client-code?

`RecoverableStream` moves stream evaluation into a separate process,
to isolate errors. It could be set to retry up to a specified number
of times, from the last retrieved value. If the stream evaluation keeps
failing, an error is propagated to a caller.

## Basic usage

`RecoverableStream.run` function takes 2 parameters: a stream 
re-creation fun and a list of options. Stream creation function
is called with the last element, obtained from a stream or `nil`
and must return a new stream:

```elixir
    gen_stream_f = fn 
      # will fail after 10 elements
      nil -> Stream.iterate(1, fn x when x < 10 -> x + 1 end)
      x   -> Stream.iterate(x + 1, &(&1+1))
    end

    res = 
      RecoverableStream.run(gen_stream_f, retry_attempts: 5)
      |> Stream.take(20)
      |> Enum.into([])

    assert Enum.into(1..n, []) == res
```

## A Practical Example

Assuming there is a table defined like:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recoverable_stream_test (a integer PRIMARY KEY, b integer, c integer)
```

`RecoverableStream` can be used to wrap `Postgrex.stream`. 
Becuase `Postgrex` API expects all stream operations to 
be conducted within a transaction. An additional `wrapper_fun`
parameter allows us to comply. The wrapper fun is allowed to
pass additional metadata to the stream creation function.

```elixir
    gen_stream = fn last_val, %{conn: conn} ->
      [from, _, _] = last_val || [0, 0, 0] 
      Postgrex.stream(conn,  "SELECT a, b, c FROM recoverable_stream_test WHERE a > $1 ORDER BY a", [from])
      |> Stream.flat_map(fn(%Postgrex.Result{rows: rows}) -> rows end) 
    end

    wrapper_fun = fn f -> 
      Postgrex.transaction(db_pid, fn(conn) -> f.(%{conn: conn}) end)
    end

    RecoverableStream.run(gen_stream, wrapper_fun: wrapper_fun)
    |> Stream.each(&IO.inspect/1)
    |> Stream.run
```
